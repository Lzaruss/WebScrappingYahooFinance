# WebScrappingYahooFinance
Simple Script that collects IBEX 35 data from Yahoo Finance. 

I use a dictionary to store the data. 
You need a Header so that yahoo does not kick you out of the page and accept cookies.
I make 2 versions, the first one works better than the second one because works faster and yahoo sometimes kicks you, but its more efficent
Then i make a DataFrame to export the data to a Excel file.
The last part of the script are answers of some questions.
