# WebScrappingYahooFinance
This code is a Python script that scrapes financial data for a number of companies listed on the Ibex35 stock exchange in Spain. The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML data, the requests library to send HTTP requests, and the pandas library to organize and store the data in a table. The script defines a dictionary called "empresa" that contains information about each company, including its name, stock price, financial data for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, and other information such as sector, subsector, and number of employees. The script also uses the rich library's "progress" module to display a progress bar while the data is being scraped. Finally, the script uses a for loop to iterate through each company in the "empresa" dictionary and scrape the relevant data from the web.
